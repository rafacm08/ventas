"""
Program to manage sales, commissions, and notifications.

This program allows store employees to add sold products to the
sales list and calculate the commission they will be paid for the
total number of products sold.
Additionally, the program allows the administrator to access
read, write, and add data commands to the invoices.txt file.
A message is also sent through the ntfy.sh API to notify the
administrator about profits and commissions.
